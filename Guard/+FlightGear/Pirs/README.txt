History

The Pirs docking compartment is a Russian module of the International Space Station (ISS). Pirs -- also called "Stikovochny Otsek 1" or "SO-1" Russian:, "docking module", or DC-1 (docking compartment) -- is one of the two Russian docking compartments originally planned for the ISS. Pirs was launched in August 2001. It provides the ISS with one docking port for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, and allows egress and ingress for spacewalks by cosmonauts using Russian Orlan space suits. When the Russian segment of the ISS was redesigned in 2001, the new design did not include the SO-2, and its construction was canceled. The SO-2 module now forms the basis for the Poisk module.The Docking Compartment has two primary functions: Serve as a airlock and as a docking port.The two airlocks are used for spacewalks by cosmonauts wearing Russian Orlan-M spacesuits.The docking port can accommodate one Soyuz-TMA or one Progress-M spacecraft. Visiting spacecraft can deliver people and cargo to and from to the space station. In addition, the Docking Compartment can transport fuel from the fuel tanks of a docked Progress resupply vehicle to either the Zvezda Service Module Integrated Propulsion System or the Zarya Functional Cargo Block. It can also transfer propellant from Zvezda and Zarya to the propulsion system of docked vehiclesâ€”Soyuz and Progress.
